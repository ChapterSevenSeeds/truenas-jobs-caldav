# TrueNAS Jobs CalDAV

#### A little Python script that reads all recurring events from a TrueNAS instance and syncs them to a CalDAV instance. This makes it so that you can see what your TrueNAS server has planned!

Can sync the following:

-   Snapshots
-   Scrubs
-   Cloud sync tasks
-   Cron jobs

# Installation

### Docker

If you already have a CalDAV server running, you can spin up a new Docker container.

```sh
docker run -d \
-e CALENDAR_ID=my_calendar \
-e CALDAV_HOST=some_server:5232 \
-e CALDAV_USERNAME=some_username \
-e CALDAV_PASSWORD=some_password \
-e TRUENAS_HOST=my_truenas:9001 \
-e TRUENAS_HOST_VERIFY_SSL=false \
-e TRUENAS_API_KEY=my_api_key \
-v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
chaptersevenseeds/truenas-jobs-caldav-sync
```

### Docker Compose

If you want a quick all-in-one solution, you can use Docker Compose.

```yaml
# compose.yaml

services:
    radicale:
        restart: unless-stopped
        image: ghcr.io/kozea/radicale
        ports:
            - 5232:5232
        volumes:
            - ~/radicale/config:/etc/radicale
            - ~/radicale/data:/var/lib/radicale
        networks: []
        user: 1000:1000
        healthcheck:
            # The radicale image only has wget, no curl.
            test: wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:5232 || exit 1
            interval: 5m
            timeout: 3s
            retries: 3
            start_period: 2m
    truenas-jobs-caldav-sync:
        restart: unless-stopped
        image: chaptersevenseeds/truenas-jobs-caldav-sync
        volumes:
            # We need this so that the times for all iCal events are correct (assuming the machine running this script will have the same timezone as your TrueNAS machine).
            - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
        depends_on:
            radicale:
                condition: service_healthy
        environment:
            - CALENDAR_ID=my_calendar
            - CALDAV_HOST=radicale:5232
            - CALDAV_USERNAME=some_username
            - CALDAV_PASSWORD=some_password
            - TRUENAS_HOST=my_truenas:9001
            - TRUENAS_HOST_VERIFY_SSL=false
            - TRUENAS_API_KEY=my_api_key
```

```conf
# ~/radicale/config/config

[auth]
type = htpasswd
htpasswd_filename = /etc/radicale/users
htpasswd_encryption = autodetect

[rights]
type = from_file
file = /etc/radicale/rights
```

```conf
# ~/radicale/config/rights

# Allow the main user to read and modify everything.
[mainUser]
user: some_username
collection: .*
permissions: RWrw

# Only allow anonymous users readonly access to the one automatically generated calendar.
[anonymous]
user: .*
collection: some_username/my_calendar(/.*)?
permissions: r
```

Then you can use `htpasswd` to generate the users file at `~/radicale/config/users`. See [here](https://radicale.org/v3.html#authentication) for a quick example of that.

## Usage

Once you have the script running and talking to your CalDAV instance, you can access your new calendar with `{caldav host}/some_username/my_calendar`. For example, `https://my-caldav-server.com/truenas-user/truenas-calendar`. Then you can add it to your Google calendar!

## Disclaimer

This script takes complete control over the calendar it creates. It will delete any events that are no longer necessary. I'd recommend against manually adding events to this calendar since they will just disappear the next time the script runs.

## Environment Variables

These are all the environment variables that the Python script can use.
| Variable | Allowed Values | Required | Default | Description |
| :------- | :------------- | :------- | :------ | :---------- |
| `CALENDAR_ID` | Anything encodable into a URL path. | Yes | - | This becomes the ID of the autogenerated calendar. If you plan on exposing this calendar to the internet, I would recommend making this a very obfuscated string so that no one accidentallyies their way into your calendar. |
| `CALDAV_HOST` | Any normal URL host and port (i.e. `192.168.1.22:5232`). | Yes | - | This is the host of your CalDAV instance. The script will attempt to connect to `http://{CALDAV_HOST}`. |
| `CALDAV_USERNAME` | Any string. | Yes | - | The username of the CalDAV user you want to use for the autogenerated calendar. |
| `CALDAV_PASSWORD` | Any string. | Yes | - | The password of the user you specified with `CALDAV_USERNAME`. |
| `TRUENAS_HOST` | Any normal URL host and port. | Yes | - | This is the host of your TrueNAS instance. The script will use [this](https://github.com/truenas/api_client) package to connect to the websocket endpoint at `"wss://{TRUENAS_HOST}/api/current"`. |
| `TRUENAS_HOST_VERIFY_SSL` | True or false. | No | true | Should the script verify SSL of the `wss` endpoint it's connecting to on your TrueNAS instance? You'll likely have to set this to false if your instance is serving the default TrueNAS certificate. I did try connecting to the `ws` endpoint on my instance, but apparently TrueNAS wasn't having it and immediately revoked my API key 🤷. |
| `TRUENAS_API_KEY` | Any string. | Yes | - | The script will authenticate with your TrueNAS instance using this API key. See [this](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/scaletutorials/toptoolbar/managingapikeys/) for help with creating a new API key. |
| `INCLUDE_SNAPSHOTS` | True or false. | No | true | Include snapshots in the generated iCal events? |
| `INCLUDE_SCRUBS` | True or false. | No | true | Include scrubs in the generated iCal events? |
| `INCLUDE_CLOUDSYNCS` | True or false. | No | true | Include cloudsync tasks in the generated iCal events? |
| `INCLUDE_CRONJOBS` | True or false. | No | true | Include CRON jobs in the generated iCal events? |
| `FAILURE_BACKOFF_TIME` | Something parseable by [this](https://pypi.org/project/durations-nlp/). | No | 15 minutes | How long to sleep after encountering an error before trying again. |
| `SYNC_INTERVAL` | Something parseable by [this](https://pypi.org/project/durations-nlp/). | No | 1 hour | Time duration between calendar syncs. |
| `SNAPSHOTS_FILTER` | Python regular expression | No | | Syncs only those snapshots whose dataset matches this regular expression. Leave empty to sync all. |
| `SCRUBS_FILTER` | Python regular expression | No | | Syncs only those scrubs whose pool name matches this regular expression. Leave empty to sync all. |
| `CLOUDSYNCS_FILTER` | Python regular expression | No | | Syncs only those cloud sync tasks whose description matches this regular expression. Leave empty to sync all. |
| `CRONJOBS_FILTER` | Python regular expression | No | | Syncs only those cronjobs whose description matches this regular expression. Leave empty to sync all. |

## TODO

-   Fix the TODO in `cron_to_ical.py`.
-   Subscribe to changes to the 4 event types and react only when something interesting happens. This will help reduce the time that the calendar is out of sync.
